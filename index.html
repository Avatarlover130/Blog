                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

                    <p>Saw it today with my family and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun. At minimum: Infinity WarCivil WarBlack Panther Age of Ant Man and the Wasp Problem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot. There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.</p>

                        <p>I love this film, being only 7 years old when the first plot came out it seemed reasonable to make a second one. It was worth waiting 6 yrs for this movie to come out and it was fantastic with an impressive sequal. the sequel was very different from the trailer of the film and a surprise ending at the end of the plot (which I will not spoil for those reading). I always found Elsas powers very magical and astounding and they became a big part of the sequal and you could really make a connection to those scenes as you probably remembered yourself trying to do those powers at home, it was merely breathtaking that, as a teenager, now to still have that same moving connection with the same film in a fresh and original way. I wouldn't recommend kids under the age of 4-5 watching it because some parts of the movie I found were a bit distressing to watch but if your kid doesn't show signs of any distress at times, it should be fine to watch the movie. an monumental twist on the second plot made that connection between the first movie and second movie with inserted flashbacks in the movie made this an imposing and powerful sequel, keep up the good work disney!</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
